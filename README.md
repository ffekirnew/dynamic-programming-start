## Usage
Each problem is contained in a folder with the same name as the problem. The folder contains a `README.md` file and a `solution.py` file with the solution. The `README.md` file contains the problem description and the solution description(s). The solution file contains a class with the same name as the problem and different methods for different solutions that receive the input and returns the output. The input and output are described in the problem description.

A typical problem folder looks like this:
```
.
├── problem_name
│   ├── README.md
│   └── solution.py
```

And a typical solution file looks like this:
```python
class ProblemName:
    def solution_1(self, input):
        # Solution 1
        return output

    def solution_2(self, input):
        # Solution 2
        return output
```

## Contribution
If you want to contribute to this repository, you can fork this repository and create a pull request with your solution. The solution must be in the `solution.py` file and the problem description must be in the `README.md` file. The solution must be in the same format as the other solutions. If you would like me to attempt a problem, you can create an issue with the problem name and description.
